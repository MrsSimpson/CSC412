# CSC412 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence

CSC 412 is a repository for my individual projects assigned for Intro to AI at USM Gulf Park
during the Fall 2018 Semester.

##Project 1 - The Maze Runner

The purpose of this program is to traverse a maze using breadth first search and also depth first search. 

The program reads in a text file that contains 100 characters in random order. The only valid characters in the file are 'W', 'P', 'E', 'X'. They will be listed in a single column.
The program will strip the '\n' character from each line before storing the single character into a 2D list 'array'.

### Requirements:
* Output the 'maze' to the console.
* Use Breadth First search to find a path to exit
* Use Depth First search to find a path to exit
* Display the route taken by each search

##Project 2 - The Slider 8 Puzzle

The purpose of this program is to create an agent that will solve a 3X3 slider puzzle using breadth first search,
depth first search, A* Search using misplaced tiles, and A* search using the Manhattan distance.

The program will prompt the user to choose a randomly generated puzzle with a random starting position, 
or to choose a user defined puzzle with the user defined starting position. After the user creates their desired puzzle, 
the user will have to choose what type of search to perform to attempt to solve the puzzle.

### Requirements:
* Professional UI
* Use BFS, DFS, A* Misplaced Tiles, and A* Manhattan distance
