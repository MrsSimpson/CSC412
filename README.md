# CSC412

The purpose of this program is to traverse a maze using breadth first search and also depth first search. 

The program reads in a text file that contains 100 characters in random order. The only valid characters in the file are 'W', 'P', 'E', 'X'. They will be listed in a single column.
The program will strip the '\n' character from each line before storing the single character into a 2D list 'array'.

Requirements:
* Output the 'maze' to the console.
* Use Breadth First search to find a path to exit
* Use Depth First search to find a path to exit
* Display the route taken by each search
